# lsBootstrap

lsBootstrap is a frontend-framework which I use to build websites. It is under
current development, and I will add some features over time.

I'm very sorry, but at this time there's no documentation available (and
probably never will be). But the code should be pretty self-explanatory. If not,
don't hesitate to contact me over at [my homepage] (http://larsschweisthal.de/).

Take a look at [the example] (htdocs/example.html)!
